Just a list of internal issues, I have wrestled with. For future reference.

## Syntax Highlighting & Mathjax



- Need extra call to `highlight.code.script()` script in outputs that are dynamically shown created needed.
- We add  `highlight.code.script()` in the ui list of a block that will be dynamically rendered and can contain code HTML. Examples are `frame`, and `task_block`.

- The function `highlight.code.script()` interferes with `withMathjax`. `highlight.code.script()` must be called inside `withMathjax`.

- The commonmark package does not render with MathJax
- If there is no internet connection, we must not call `withMathJax`, chunks won't be shown otherwise.
